# Diabetes Classification Comparison Between Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, And Decision Tree

This project explains how to classify diabetes from several factors using machine learning and compares it between Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.
This notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for building and evaluating classification models using a diabetes dataset. The process begins with importing essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn`. The dataset is loaded and explored through methods like `head()`, data type inspection, and shape analysis. Preprocessing steps include converting the target variable (`Outcome`) to a categorical type, checking for missing values, and applying `MinMaxScaler` for feature scaling. The data is then split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 75%-25% or 80%-20%. Multiple classification models are implemented, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, each evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. Additionally, exploratory data analysis is performed to visualize the distribution of the target variable. This notebook aims to compare the performance of these classification models in predicting diabetes outcomes.
